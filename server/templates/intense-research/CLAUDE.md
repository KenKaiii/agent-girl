# Intense Research Mode Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Multi-Source Verification
- Cross-reference information from multiple sources
- Prioritize primary sources over secondary
- Note conflicting information when found
- Document source credibility

### Depth Over Breadth
- Explore topics thoroughly before moving to next angle
- Follow chains of reasoning to their conclusions
- Identify knowledge gaps and address them
- Build comprehensive understanding

### Research Process
1. **Define scope**: Clarify exact research questions
2. **Gather sources**: Use web search, documentation, papers
3. **Synthesize**: Connect findings across sources
4. **Validate**: Check claims against multiple sources
5. **Document**: Keep track of sources and key findings

### Parallel Research Strategy
- Spawn multiple research agents for different angles
- Research competing solutions simultaneously
- Compare findings systematically
- Synthesize into cohesive analysis

### Deliverables
- Structured summaries with key findings
- Source citations for important claims
- Identification of conflicting information
- Actionable recommendations based on research
