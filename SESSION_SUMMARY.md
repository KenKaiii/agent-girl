# Session Summary: Windows Support & Enhanced Installer

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Session**: Continuation from Apple notarization and automated distribution setup

## Overview

This session focused on expanding the Agent Girl distribution system with Windows support and creating a seamless installation experience that requires zero manual configuration.

## Completed Work

### 1. Windows x64 Build Support

**Objective**: Add Windows x64 builds to the existing GitHub Actions release workflow alongside macOS ARM64 and Intel builds.

**Implementation**:
- Added complete `build-windows` job to `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Used PowerShell syntax for Windows-specific build steps
- Configured Bun compilation target: `bun-windows-x64`
- Created Windows-specific README and .env template
- Updated `create-release` job to include Windows artifacts

**Result**:
- ✅ All 3 platforms build successfully in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Release v1.0.0 contains: `agent-girl-macos-arm64.zip`, `agent-girl-macos-intel.zip`, `agent-girl-windows-x64.zip`
- ✅ Build times: ~1m36s (ARM64), ~1m44s (Intel), ~1m52s (Windows)

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Added Windows build job (lines 187-293)

### 2. Repository Visibility & Installer Fix

**Issue**: curl installer failed with HTTP 404 because repository was private.

**Resolution**:
1. User made repository public
2. Fixed repository URL in `install.sh` from `UnstableMind/agent-boy2` to `KenKaiii/agent-girl`
3. Verified GitHub API accessibility and releases endpoint
4. Tested local installation successfully

**Result**:
- ✅ One-line curl install works: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenKaiii/agent-girl/master/install.sh | bash`
- ✅ Automatic architecture detection
- ✅ Downloads correct binary from latest release

**Files Modified**:
- `install.sh` - Updated REPO variable (line 12)

### 3. Interactive API Key Setup

**Objective**: Make installation completely seamless by collecting API keys during setup and automatically creating configured .env file.

**User Requirement**: *"People are VERY STUPID. So making it easy on all fronts is crucial."*

**Implementation**:
- Interactive menu with 4 options:
  1. Anthropic API only (Claude models)
  2. Z.AI API only (GLM models)
  3. Both APIs (full model access)
  4. Skip (configure later)
- Real-time API key collection with provider-specific prompts
- Automatic .env file generation with user's actual keys
- Helpful links to API key registration pages
- Clear success/skip messages

**Code Sections**:
```bash
# API selection menu (lines 111-164)
echo "Which API provider(s) do you want to use?"
echo "  1) Anthropic API only (Claude models)"
echo "  2) Z.AI API only (GLM models)"
echo "  3) Both APIs (full model access)"
echo "  4) Skip (configure later)"
read -p "Enter choice [1-4]: " api_choice

# Conditional key collection based on choice
# Automatic .env generation with real keys (lines 173-186)
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Zero manual .env configuration required
- ✅ Users can start using the app immediately after installation
- ✅ Graceful skip option for advanced users
- ✅ Clear provider documentation links

**Files Modified**:
- `install.sh` - Added API key setup section (lines 111-191)

### 4. Global Command Launcher

**Objective**: Enable users to run `agent-girl` from anywhere in the terminal.

**Implementation**:
- Creates launcher script at `/usr/local/bin/agent-girl`
- Attempts permission-free creation first
- Gracefully requests sudo if needed
- Provides clear opt-out option
- Updates success message based on launcher status

**Code Section**:
```bash
# Global launcher with sudo handling (lines 193-221)
LAUNCHER_SCRIPT="#!/bin/bash
cd \"$INSTALL_DIR\" && ./$APP_NAME \"\$@\"
"

# Try without sudo first
if echo "$LAUNCHER_SCRIPT" > "$LAUNCHER_PATH" 2>/dev/null; then
  # Success - no sudo needed
else
  # Request sudo with clear explanation
  read -p "Create global launcher with sudo? [y/N]: " use_sudo
fi
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Users can type `agent-girl` from anywhere
- ✅ No forced sudo - asks permission first
- ✅ Works with command-line arguments: `agent-girl --port 3002`
- ✅ Falls back to manual instructions if declined

**Files Modified**:
- `install.sh` - Added global launcher section (lines 193-221)
- `install.sh` - Updated success message (lines 223-249)

## Git Commits

**Commit 1**: Windows build support
**Commit 2**: Fixed repository URL in installer
**Commit 3**: Interactive API key setup and global launcher
```
Add interactive API key setup and improved global launcher

- Interactive menu for API provider selection (Anthropic, Z.AI, or both)
- Collect and configure API keys during installation
- Write keys directly to .env (no manual editing needed)
- Graceful sudo handling for global launcher
- Improved success message based on install options
- Clearer user experience for all skill levels
```

## Technical Highlights

### Multi-Platform Build Strategy
- **macOS**: Code-signed and notarized with Apple Developer ID
- **Windows**: Unsigned (no code signing configured yet)
- **Architecture detection**: Automatic in install script
- **Target binaries**:
  - `bun-darwin-arm64` (Apple Silicon)
  - `bun-darwin-x64` (Intel)
  - `bun-windows-x64` (Windows)

### Installation Flow
1. User runs curl command
2. Script detects architecture
3. Downloads latest release from GitHub API
4. Extracts to `~/Applications/agent-girl-app/`
5. **Interactive API key collection**
6. **Automatic .env file creation**
7. Sets executable permissions
8. **Optionally creates global launcher**
9. Displays context-aware success message

### User Experience Improvements
- **Before**: Download zip → Extract → Edit .env → Run binary
- **After**: Run one command → Answer 2-3 prompts → Type `agent-girl`

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | +107 | Windows build job |
| `install.sh` | +149 | API setup + global launcher |
| Total | +256 lines | Complete distribution system |

## Testing Results

### GitHub Actions
- ✅ macOS ARM64 build: 1m36s
- ✅ macOS Intel build: 1m44s
- ✅ Windows x64 build: 1m52s
- ✅ Release created with all 3 artifacts

### Local Installation
- ✅ curl download works
- ✅ Architecture detection works (Apple Silicon detected)
- ✅ Binary extraction successful
- ✅ Interactive API key prompts work
- ✅ .env file created correctly
- ✅ Global launcher created (sudo required)
- ✅ `agent-girl` command works from any directory

## Distribution URLs

**Install command**:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenKaiii/agent-girl/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Direct downloads**: https://github.com/KenKaiii/agent-girl/releases/latest

**Supported platforms**:
- macOS 11+ (Big Sur or later) - Intel & Apple Silicon
- Windows 10+ (x64)

## Key Decisions

1. **Public repository**: Required for curl installer to work seamlessly
2. **No forced sudo**: Users can opt-out of global launcher
3. **Interactive API setup**: Balances convenience with security (keys never stored in script)
4. **Skip option**: Advanced users can configure manually if preferred
5. **Provider-specific prompts**: Clear documentation links for each API

## Known Limitations

1. Windows binary is **unsigned** - users will see SmartScreen warning on first run
2. Global launcher requires sudo on macOS (unless /usr/local/bin is world-writable)
3. API keys entered in terminal (visible in plain text during entry)
4. No automatic updates - users must re-run installer

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Windows code signing (requires Windows Developer certificate)
- [ ] Homebrew tap for macOS (`brew install agent-girl`)
- [ ] Linux support (AppImage or .deb package)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism
- [ ] Secure API key entry (hidden input)

## Success Metrics

- **Installation complexity**: Reduced from 5 manual steps to 1 command
- **Configuration required**: Reduced from manual .env editing to 0
- **Time to first run**: ~2 minutes (from download to running app)
- **Platform coverage**: 3 platforms (macOS ARM64, macOS Intel, Windows x64)
- **User skill required**: Beginner-friendly (as per user requirement: *"People are VERY STUPID"*)
